"""
Hacky script to attempt to return the ID of a 'free' GPU instance

This version of the script attempts to maintain a list of process IDs
and GPU allocations. It cleans up the list each time it runs (with locking)
to remove processes that have completed, and then chooses a random GUID
from those that are unused and adds it to the list of process allocations
and outputs the GUID to be used in CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES.
